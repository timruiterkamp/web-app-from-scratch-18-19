# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 18-19

In this project I build a Web app from scratch using API. The use case of this project is viewing the DATA and getting specific information about the DATA.

## Live demo

The live demo can be found at: [https://timruiterkamp.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/src](https://timruiterkamp.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/src)

## Installation

Clone the repository through:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timruiterkamp/web-app-from-scratch-18-19.git
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
  yarn or npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## What is my app good for?

My app is a representation of the current premiere league standing with the possibility to get insight to a club and player.

## Which actors are there in my application?

## What API has been used and what is the limit of the API.

The api that has been used is the [football-data API](https://football-data.org). The football-data API is a very big dataset with over 176 competitions in it, container every information about the clubs in the competitions and the players in the clubs.

Data that I used:

- Premiere League competition
- Premiere League standing
- Premiere League clubs
- Premiere League players

## How does interaction flow through the application

The user will be landing on the homepage where they can find information about the club in the Premiere League they support, they can see their score, goals made / goals against, standing on the league table and opponents they have to face in the next round of the Premiere League.

If they are interested in their team or in the team they have to face in the next round, they can click on the team name and look through their an overview of their players and details about the players.
